            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the fundamental language used to create web pages. It structures content on the web by utilizing elements or tags to describe the structure and presentation of text, images, links, and multimedia. HTML documents consist of various components such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, forms, and links, all of which are defined by specific HTML tags.<br><br> The most basic structure of an HTML document includes a head section for metadata, such as the document title and character encoding, and a body section that contains the visible content of the webpage. HTML allows developers to define how content is displayed in the browser through the use of specific tags and attributes, providing a rich way to represent information in a web-friendly format. The structure of a web page can be enhanced by linking external resources such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, making HTML an essential part of web development. With the introduction of HTML5, new semantic elements were introduced, offering a more meaningful way to structure content, improve accessibility, and boost SEO. Multimedia elements such as video and audio can be embedded directly in web pages without the need for plugins. Forms are another important HTML feature, allowing users to submit data to web servers, which is often used for tasks like filling out contact forms or creating user accounts. Overall, HTML provides the foundation for building dynamic and interactive websites, and when combined with CSS and JavaScript, it forms the building blocks of modern web design and development.
